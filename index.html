          <h1>Countdown JS</h1>

<p>This is a simple countdown script. I get too many clients asking for the same thing. I don't like the other scripts I saw online as they use a lot of inline Javascript and HTML. I wanted a script that is truly unobtrusive, and that you can re-use easily with any application. This is it. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Any bugs or issues, feel free to fork and do a pull request.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<p>Include the countdown.js in your application in the </p> tags:

<pre><code>&lt;script src="countdown.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Invoke the countdown like this:</p>

<pre><code>//You must always have the target date and the current date
//The current date is the date of your server so that you don't run into timezone issues
//Use your server side programming (PHP/Ruby/Python/ASP, etc) to output a date that you can read in using Javascript
var target_date = new Date(2012, 12, 25, 0, 0, 0);
var current_date = new Date(2012, 07, 04, 0, 0, 0);

//Create the countdown object
var count = new Countdown(target_date, current_date);

//Run the countdown
count.countdown(function(obj) {
    //Do anything you want with the obj, which contains days, hours, minutes, seconds
    //This will be called every one second as the countdown timer goes
    console.debug(obj);

    //E.g. you might use jQuery to update the countdown
    $('#days').html(obj.days);
    $('#hours').html(obj.hours);
    $('#minutes').html(obj.minutes);
    $('#seconds').html(obj.seconds);
});
</code></pre>
